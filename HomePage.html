        <p> Stella Talavera is a visual communication design student with a minor in marketing at San Francisco State University. 
            After taking a gap year she started at City College of San Francisco as a marine biology major and transferred to 
            visual communication and floral design later on, at the beginning of  2024, she transferred to SFSU.
            Stella's passion for art and design was greatly influenced by her mother, 
            who was an art teacher and coordinated various art productions and events at her school. 
            Growing up, Stella often assisted her mother in creating artwork, which ignited her love for design. 
            She has known since a young age that she wanted to pursue a career in this field. 
            Currently, she is exploring her interests in labeling design, marketing, and typography for her future career.
            At 24 years old, Stella grew up in Nicaragua
            and moved to San Francisco with her family in 2018. In her free time, she enjoys reading, creating art, 
            and spending time with her two dogs, Lola and Mika. She also loves hanging out with friends and family, visiting new places, 
            trying out different restaurants around the Bay Area, and working on floral arrangements.</p>
